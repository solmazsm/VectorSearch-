# VectorSearch

This folder contains all the necessary implementation to replicate studies presented on 50th International Conference on Very Large Databases, 2024.

# Dataset
VectorSearch Dataset: The VectorSearch dataset is a collection of news articles that have been indexed using vector embeddings for efficient search and retrieval. It contains a vast array of articles spanning various topics and sources, providing researchers with a rich corpus for exploration and analysis.

The dataset encompasses news articles from multiple sources, including but not limited to those compiled by the NewsCatcher team and the All the News dataset. The VectorSearch dataset leverages vector embeddings to represent the semantic content of articles, enabling advanced search capabilities based on semantic similarity.

By harnessing the power of vector embeddings, the VectorSearch dataset offers researchers the opportunity to delve into large-scale text analysis tasks, such as clustering, classification, and recommendation systems. The incorporation of vector embeddings allows for more nuanced and context-aware search and retrieval compared to traditional keyword-based methods.

With its extensive collection of news articles across various topics and sources, the VectorSearch dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in exploring the dynamics of media content, analyzing trends, and understanding the dissemination of information in the digital age.

# Download Dataset

<a href="https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset">All the News:</a> This dataset contains 2,688,878 news articles and essays from 27 American publications, spanning January 1,2016 to April 2, 2020. It is an expanded edition of the original All the News dataset, which was compiled in early 2017. While the original dataset contains more than 100,000 articles, the new datasetâ€™s greater size and breadth should allow researchers to study a wider selection of media.

<a href=" https://www.newscatcherapi.com/">NewsCatcher: Data on news topics was collected by the NewsCatcherteam, which collects and indexes 108k news articles spanning eight topics: business, entertainment, health, nation, science,
sports, technology, and the world.
